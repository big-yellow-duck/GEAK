"""GEAK v4 bootstrap package.

GEAK v4 is not a conventional Python library — its workflows run through
Codex CLI or Claude Code from a repo checkout. This package only exists so that

    pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK

can (a) install the Python runtime deps and (b) run a best-effort bootstrap
that clones the full repo locally and installs the selected agent CLI.

Keep this module import-safe at build time: no third-party imports here.
