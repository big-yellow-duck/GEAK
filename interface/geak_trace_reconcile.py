"""Identity-first reconciliation for the GEAK execution tracker.

Every retention bug the tracker has had came from the same mistake: merging a
DERIVED summary (a list length, a total byte count, an endpoint pair, a
lexicographic score) after the information that distinguished the records had
already been discarded. Aggregates cannot tell "this block shrank" from "a
different block grew", and a resolved edge cannot remember that it was later
contradicted.

So reconciliation happens here, on the records themselves, keyed by stable
identity, BEFORE anything is derived from them:

  call        (agent_id, call_id)
  input block (call_id, source_uuid, kind, position)
  tool action tool_use_id
  attempt     (spawn_event_id, attempt_id)
  edge        (type, from, to, event_id | spawn_event_id)

Each reconciled item carries an explicit state:

  ``observed``   present in the latest read of its source
  ``retained``   absent from the latest read, kept from an earlier capture
  ``replayed``   seen again, byte-identical: idempotent
  ``conflicted`` seen again with contradictory identity-defining fields

``conflicted`` is sticky. A claim that has been contradicted does not become
true again because a later pass happens not to see the contradiction, so a
conflicted identity can never be resurrected as proven; the disputed evidence is
kept for inspection instead. Callers derive graphs, counters and coverage from
this store, so every view agrees and none of them re-invents a merge rule.
