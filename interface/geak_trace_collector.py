"""Live execution tracker for a GEAK workflow run (e2e or kernel lane).

Reads the three artifacts the Claude Code runtime writes *while a workflow is
running* and joins them into one durable trace:

  <workflow_dir>/journal.jsonl        orchestration events (authoritative ORDER,
                                      agent identity, and the result each agent
                                      returned to the workflow)
  <workflow_dir>/agent-<id>.meta.json per-agent metadata (label, spawn depth)
  <workflow_dir>/agent-<id>.jsonl     per-agent transcript (API calls, tool
                                      actions, tool results, token usage)

What this module will and will not claim
----------------------------------------
The journal proves *who ran* and *what each agent returned to the workflow*. In
the runs observed so far it carries NO timestamps, every ``started.phase`` is the
same workflow label, and ``meta.spawnDepth`` is a level, never a parent id. So:

* orchestration edges (workflow -> agent) and return edges (agent -> workflow)
  are emitted as PROVEN, sourced from journal records;
* a role ordering such as tech_lead-before-engineer is a DATA DEPENDENCY of the
  workflow script, not evidence that one agent spawned another, so no such edge
  is invented here;
* wall-clock timing is derived from transcript record timestamps and is marked
  ``estimated`` -- it is not provider latency, and cumulative elapsed is an
  offset from the run origin, never a sum of overlapping spans;
* an input excerpt is the new transcript input since the previous response, NOT
  the full API request: the system prompt, tool definitions and inherited
  context are not recoverable from a transcript and are never implied here.

Everything unknown is recorded as an explicit marker rather than a blank.

Collection is read-only and side-effect free with respect to the run: it never
influences model choice, prompts, budgets or optimization decisions, and a
failure to collect is reported, never raised into the caller's workflow.
