"""Render a GEAK run as a clickable role-execution tree (HTML + Markdown).

The per-call ledger (``reports/trace/llm_calls.jsonl``, written by
``e2e_workflow/scripts/llm_ledger.py``) answers *what each API call cost*. This
module turns that flat list into the shape a human reads a run in: a tree that
starts at the Director, nests the TechLead under it, the engineers and verifiers
under the TechLead, and the helper scopes beside them — one node per agent call.
Clicking a node reveals that agent's cost (split into cache-write / cache-read /
uncached-context / router / output), its wall time, its tokens, and the prompt
and output (thinking + response) it exchanged.

Why a heuristic tree. The transcripts carry no literal "agent X spawned agent Y"
edge — ``parentUuid`` only links messages WITHIN one agent's own chain. So the
hierarchy is reconstructed from two things the logs DO carry: each agent's role
(``director`` outranks ``tech_lead`` outranks ``engineer`` …) and its execution
order (first-call timestamp). An agent nests under the most recent
higher-ranked agent still open — the same way the run actually delegated. Unknown
roles fall back to leaves in execution order, so a workflow this file has never
seen still renders, just flatter.

Both run styles share this: kernel-lane and E2E differ only in their role names,
and the rank table below covers both. The renderer reads only ``llm_calls.jsonl``,
so it has no dependency on any external report tool.

Usage:
  python3 geak_call_tree_html.py --calls <path/to/llm_calls.jsonl> \
      --out-dir <dir> [--model <name>]
Writes ``<dir>/geak_run_report_<model>.html`` and ``.md``.
