"""Tests for run-scoped transcript discovery (claude_trace_mirror).

These lock the contamination fix: the report ledger must bill a run for the
transcripts THAT RUN OWNS and nothing else. The old path is substring discovery
in llm_ledger — any concurrent session whose transcript merely mentions the
eval-dir path gets attributed to the run, inflating call count and cost (a real
kernel run rendered 1,239 calls / $144 instead of its true 500 / $47). Scoping
to the run's own ``subagents/workflows/<runId>/agent-*.jsonl`` removes that class
of error by construction; that is what these tests pin.
