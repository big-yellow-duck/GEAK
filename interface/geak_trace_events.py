"""Explicit linkage contracts for the GEAK execution tracker.

Two relationships cannot be recovered from a transcript after the fact, because
nothing in the recorded data states them:

  * **result_supplied_to_dispatch** -- that a producer agent's returned result
    was supplied as input when a later agent was dispatched;
  * **spawn / return** -- that one agent invocation spawned another, and which
    return belongs to that spawn.

Byte-identical text in a producer's result and a consumer's prompt does NOT
establish the first: it shows only that both records contain those bytes. The
same text is returned by more than one producer in real runs, a path can come
independently from workflow arguments, and ordering does not disambiguate any of
that. A tool named ``Task``/``Agent``, or a ``spawnDepth`` level, does not
establish the second either: neither identifies WHICH parent, nor joins a child's
return to the event that started it.

So this module defines what a producer of those events must record for the edge
to exist, validates such events, and builds edges ONLY from validated ones.
Anything unknown or contradictory stays incomplete and is reported as such --
never completed by inference.

SCOPE CLAIM, stated precisely: this is an ADAPTER AND SCHEMA plus its fixtures.
Fixture support establishes that the tracker consumes these events correctly.
It does NOT establish that the native runtime emits them. Historical runs get
only the relationships their own records already support, and no legacy link is
ever synthesised here.
