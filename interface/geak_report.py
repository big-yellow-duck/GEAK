"""One entry point that turns a GEAK run into its report — for both run styles.

A run leaves behind Claude transcripts; this driver turns them into the
role-execution-tree report (HTML + Markdown) in two steps that already exist as
separate tools:

  1. ``e2e_workflow/scripts/llm_ledger.py`` reads the transcripts and writes the
     per-call ledger ``reports/trace/llm_calls.jsonl`` (tokens, wall time, and —
     since the ledger was extended — per-call output/thinking and the cost-bucket
     split).
  2. ``interface/geak_call_tree_html.py`` folds that ledger into the clickable
     role tree and renders ``report/geak_run_report_<model>.{html,md}``.

The two run styles differ only in where the transcripts live, which is the one
thing this driver hides:
  * E2E workflow — pass ``--eval-dir <run>``; the ledger discovers the run's own
    transcripts under it.
  * Kernel lane — pass ``--transcripts '<glob>'`` (repeatable) pointing at the
    session's ``subagents/**/agent-*.jsonl``; ``--eval-dir`` is then just the
    scratch dir the ledger writes into (defaults to a temp dir).

With ``--persist`` the whole set is copied into the shared layout
``<persist-root>/<model>/{geak_run_ledger,geak_llm_artifacts,report}/`` so a run's
telemetry, per-call JSON, and report sit together. (``claude_llm_artifacts`` — the
raw mirrored transcripts — is populated by ``claude_trace_mirror``, out of scope
here; the folder is created so the layout is complete.)

Usage:
  # E2E run
  python3 interface/geak_report.py --eval-dir /path/to/e2e_<model>_<stamp>
  # kernel lane
  python3 interface/geak_report.py \
      --transcripts '/path/session/subagents/**/agent-*.jsonl' \
      --model Qwen3-14B-FP8
