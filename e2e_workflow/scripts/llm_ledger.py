"""Per-API-call token + wall-clock ledger for a GEAK run.

GEAK measures what it achieves and nothing about what it spends. This closes that: one row
for every single LLM request the run made, however small, joined to the phase that made it,
plus how long each call and each phase took.

WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
  Tokens are NOT estimated. Claude Code writes a transcript for every session and sub-agent
  under ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl, and every assistant record in it carries the exact
  usage the API billed:
      input_tokens                 text sent fresh, full price
      cache_creation_input_tokens  text stored so later calls can re-send it cheaply (~25% surcharge)
      cache_read_input_tokens      text re-sent that was already stored (one tenth price)
      output_tokens                text generated
  One assistant record == one API call. Two details bite and are handled: the same response is
  sometimes written twice with an identical message.id (deduplicated here), and cache_creation
  splits into 5-minute and 1-hour buckets that are priced differently.

  Per-call duration is the gap between an assistant record and the record before it in the same
  conversation — how long that request took to come back.

  Phase comes from the workflow itself. The JS workflows record a timeline (which agent ran, in
  which phase, when, for how long) and persist it to reports/trace/agent_timeline.json. That is
  the authoritative source, because prompt text alone is ambiguous: `bakeoff` runs in both
  HeadKernel and Milestone, and `setup` runs in both Setup and Benchmark. With no timeline the
  ledger still builds, attributing by prompt text and time window, and marks itself "inferred".

USAGE
  python3 llm_ledger.py --eval-dir <dir>                     # normal: called at end of a run
  python3 llm_ledger.py --eval-dir <dir> --transcripts 'X/*.jsonl'   # explicit transcripts
  python3 llm_ledger.py --eval-dir <dir> --rates my_rates.json       # override prices

OUTPUT (all under <eval_dir>/reports/trace/)
  llm_calls.jsonl    one row per API call — the raw ledger
  agent_calls.jsonl  one row per agent invocation, with attempts and outcome
  token_stats.json   every table below, machine-readable
  token_stats.md     the same tables, rendered

NEVER RAISES on bad input. A missing or unreadable transcript produces a ledger marked
incomplete with a stated reason — this runs at the end of a multi-hour GPU run and must not be
able to fail it.

Stdlib only.

# Prices, in dollars per million tokens. ONE home for every rate, so a wrong
# price is a one-line correction that never touches the arithmetic below.

# switch mid-run — is priced call by call, not at one run-wide rate.

# (0.025x). `_default` (the Opus 4.8 / Opus 5 card) prices a call whose model is
# unknown; a real model missing from this table is reported, never silently
# priced (see unpriced_models). Override with --rates <file.json>: its keys are

    the whole reason the timeline exists) is resolved POSITIONALLY: within one
    label, the workflow's Nth recorded attempt is the Nth conversation in time
    order. That works without clocks, which the workflow does not have.

    Conversations are first split by which workflow they belong to. Most roles
    appear in only one of them; `director` appears in both, and is placed by
    whether the prompt refers to a kernel-layer eval dir.

    When a label has more recorded attempts than conversations — a retry that
    hung, or an API error before any response — the surplus attempts are left
    unmatched and reported separately with zero calls. Which attempt is left over
    follows from the positional rule and is not knowable from the data; what
    matters is that the attempt is not silently dropped.
