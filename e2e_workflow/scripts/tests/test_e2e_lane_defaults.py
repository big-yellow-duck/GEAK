"""test_e2e_lane_defaults.py — e2e launches the kernel lane with the learned KB OFF by default.

Same worker, different prior. A kernel_workflow campaign re-optimizes a fixed benchmark set, where a
card distilled from an earlier run of the same kernel is exactly the point. e2e extracts whatever the
profiler surfaces from a live server, so a card carrying another run's conclusions about a
superficially similar op is a prior nobody asked for — and the e2e layer has never been measured with
it on. So kernel_workflow defaults on, e2e defaults off, and `args.use_learned_kb` overrides either.

The interesting failure is not "the default is wrong" — it is "the default is right at six call
sites and absent at the seventh". e2e invokes the lane from seven places today; anything that misses
the injection silently takes the LANE's default, which is on. So this derives the call sites from the
file rather than checking a list, and requires each one to route through `laneArgs`.
