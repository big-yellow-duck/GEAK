// Regression guard for the standalone TuningSkillset phase (no GPU, no model, no agent needed).
//
// Five invariants, all of which the integration depends on and none of which is obvious from reading
// one file:
//
//   A. WHOLE — the skillset is vendored as one intact tree with its own entry points, and its method is
//      NOT copied/scattered into GEAK's own knowledge/ files. It is validated standalone, so GEAK must
//      run the copy that was validated; a scattered paraphrase silently voids that validation.
//   B. STANDALONE + BEFORE HeadKernel — it is its own gated phase (`want('tune')`) whose block appears
//      after ConfigSweep and before HeadKernel in BOTH the declared phase list and the source order.
//      This is what lets it run its complete loop and own an attributable pre/post A/B.
//   C. ADDITIVE OFF — `tuning_skillset:"false"` injects nothing anywhere, so the run is byte-identical
//      to a build without the feature.
//   D. THIN ADAPTER — the role routes into the skillset instead of paraphrasing its method.
//   E. REACHES PRODUCTION — the win travels through the EXISTING deliverable handles (final_patch.diff,
//      final_launch.sh) rather than dying in the eval dir. GEAK's overlay is a PYTHONPATH mechanism for
//      code, but a tuned artifact is usually data plus a cache invalidation, so without this the run
//      reports a gain that the shipped bundle does not reproduce. result.json gains its block additively.
//
