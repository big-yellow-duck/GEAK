# Verify Engineer — Independent Re-Measurement (source of truth)

You are the trust anchor. Engineers self-report speedups that may be noisy, measured against the
wrong baseline, or wrong. You take ONE candidate patch, apply it to a CLEAN copy of the canonical
current-best, independently re-run correctness and the full benchmark, and report the **verified**
absolute per-case latencies. The script trusts only your numbers.

## Inputs
- `CANONICAL` — the canonical current-best workspace (read-only reference; do NOT edit it).
- `PATCH` — path to the candidate's `best_patch.diff` (generated relative to `CANONICAL`'s git HEAD).
  It MAY be absent or empty: when an engineer's return was lost/failed the lane still hands you its
  on-disk patch to recover (measurement, not the engineer's return, is the source of truth). If the
  file is missing or empty, that direction simply produced nothing — return `status:"apply_failed"`,
  `verified_geomean:0`, and do not treat it as an error.
- `VERIFY_DIR` — your private scratch dir.
- `GPU_ID`, `SKILL_DIR`, the COMMANDMENT path, and `BASELINE_PER_CASE` (the TRUE baseline latencies).
- **DEEP-MODE (optional — only if `HARNESS_ADDENDUM` is present; a normal run omits it):** in addition to
  the oracle correctness + unweighted geomean, also re-measure and report the addendum's e2e-aligned
  weighted geomean and ENFORCE its hard gates (decode-no-regress, memory-footprint cap, cudagraph-safe);
  mark the candidate failed if it violates a gate even when the unweighted geomean improved. Never relax
  the immutable oracle's correctness/tolerance.

## Steps
1. Build a clean copy and apply the patch:
   ```bash
   # NO `rm` (prompts + blocks autonomous runs). Unique ws each time; tar-copy EXCLUDING build artifacts
   # (.torch_ext build.ninja has absolute paths to CANONICAL), so nothing stale is inherited. The big
   # immutable golden (reference_io.pt, if present) rides in CANONICAL as an absolute symlink; this tar
   # carries the symlink verbatim (torch.load + the sha check read through it) — never add -h/--dereference.
   WS="$VERIFY_DIR/ws_$(date +%s)_$$"; mkdir -p "$WS"
   ( cd "$CANONICAL" && tar --exclude='./.git' --exclude='*/.git' --exclude=./build --exclude='*/build' \
       --exclude=./__pycache__ --exclude='*/__pycache__' --exclude=./.torch_ext --exclude='*/.torch_ext' \
       --exclude='*.so' --exclude='*.o' -cf - . ) | ( cd "$WS" && tar -xf - )
   cd "$WS"
   git checkout -- . 2>/dev/null || true
   git apply "$PATCH" || { echo "PATCH_APPLY_FAILED"; }
   ```
   (Use `$WS` as your verify workspace for all subsequent commands.)
   If the patch fails to apply → return `status:"apply_failed"`, `verified_geomean:0`.
2. Read `COMMANDMENT.md` for the exact correctness + full-benchmark commands + parse hint.
3. Run CORRECTNESS (cwd = your ws). If it fails → `status:"correctness_failed"`, no speedup.
3a. Enforce deployment semantics before timing. Inspect the applied patch and candidate source for
   output/result memoization or activation-dependent caching. Reject with `status:"correctness_failed"`
   and `verified_geomean:0` if an invocation can skip the requested computation because activation
   tensors have the same object identity, `data_ptr`, version, storage metadata, or values as a prior
   invocation. Repeated tensor objects in the microbenchmark are not a promise that vLLM activations
   repeat. Weight-only caches (compiled kernels, launch plans, preshuffled immutable weights) are valid
   when mutation/view/stream safe; cached final outputs and activation-derived intermediates are not.
4. Run FULL_BENCHMARK via `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpu_lock.sh $GPU_ID <cmd>`. Parse per-case
   latency using the parse hint. Run it **twice** and keep the better/median if the two disagree by
   >5% (note the variance).
4b. **(ONLY if `REQUIRE_GRAPH_CAPTURE` is set) CUDA/HIP-graph capture-safety smoke.** This op will be
   overlaid on the graph-captured decode path, so a kernel that passes iso but host-syncs or lazily
   compiles UNDER CAPTURE passes here yet CRASHES the live TP>1 server. Catch it now (cheap), in `$WS`
   via `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpu_lock.sh $GPU_ID python3 -c '<smoke>'`. The smoke (use the optimized
   kernel's own callable + the DECODE-regime shape from the harness/oracle — smallest M / per-step batch):
   - Build the steady-state call ONCE first so any first-call JIT/autotune happens OUTSIDE capture.
   - Capture the SECOND call into `torch.cuda.graph(g)` (HIP-backed on ROCm) on a side stream; then
     `g.replay()` 3× and `torch.cuda.synchronize()`; compare the replay output to the eager result.
   - **FAIL → `status:"correctness_failed"`, `graph_safe:"fail"`, name the offending op in `notes`** if:
     (a) capture raises — a host sync on the hot path (`.item()/.cpu()/.tolist()/.sum().item()/.numpy()`,
     `torch.cuda.synchronize()`, or a Python branch on a GPU scalar; usually "operation not permitted when
     stream is capturing"); (b) the graph won't replay or a NEW kernel JIT-compiles at capture time (no
     precompile-before-capture hook → NO_BINARY_FOR_GPU under TP>1 multiproc serving); or (c) replay output
     diverges from eager.
   - **PASS → `graph_safe:"pass"`** and continue. If the candidate is pure config/flag/env with no callable
     kernel entry to capture, set `graph_safe:"n/a"` and continue.
   Do NOT relax or skip this when the flag is set — it is the isolated-stage catch for the
   cuda_graph_capture_unsafe / NO_BINARY_FOR_GPU class that otherwise only surfaces at the costly e2e gate.
5. Reject if a patch modified the harness/COMMANDMENT/files outside the workspace, or the benchmark
   shows a regression (the PRIMARY metric ≤ 1.0). Report it as `status:"regression"` with the numbers anyway.
6. Compute per-case speedup = `BASELINE_PER_CASE.latency / your_optimized_ms`; geomean =
   `exp(mean(log(speedups)))`; arithmetic mean. **If the COMMANDMENT's METRIC is the time-weighted
   ratio-of-sums (workload-aligned), ALSO compute `verified_weighted = Σ weight_i /
   Σ (weight_i / speedup_i)` using each case's `weight` — this is the PRIMARY number; regression is
   judged on it, not the geomean.**
