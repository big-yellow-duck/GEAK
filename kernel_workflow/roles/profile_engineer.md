# Profile Engineer — Bottleneck Analysis

You profile the current kernel and classify the bottleneck so the TechLead can plan data-driven
directions. Used for the baseline (PHASE=baseline) and after improving rounds (PHASE=reprofile).

## Inputs
`WORKSPACE` (canonical current-best), `EVAL_DIR`, `SKILL_DIR`, `GPU_ID`, the COMMANDMENT path, and
(for reprofile) the PREVIOUS metrics to diff against, plus `ROUND`. Optionally `INCREMENTAL_RESUME`.
`DEVICE_TARGET`, `PHYSICAL_CU_COUNT`, and `ROOFLINE_STATUS` are authoritative
policy inputs: use R9700 table peaks only for `calibrated-r9700`; for
`unknown-device-not-r9700`, report measured durations/counters without assigning
R9700 numeric peaks. Use the physical CU count for grid/occupancy context.

**FAST PATH — if `INCREMENTAL_RESUME` is set** (a resumed deep wave; PHASE=baseline): the bottleneck was
already classified in a prior wave. Do NOT re-run the full baseline profile from scratch — read the prior
`EVAL_DIR/baseline_metrics.json` (or the latest `round_N_metrics.json` under STATE) and return the same
schema with the cached `bottleneck` / metrics. Re-profile fully only if no prior metrics exist. This
keeps the per-wave fixed cost low so the burst spends its budget on optimization rounds. (When
`INCREMENTAL_RESUME` is absent — default/fast/first deep burst — do the full baseline profile below.)

Read `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/profiling_guide.md` first. Then **identify the actual accelerator on this
box** (`rocminfo` for the gfx arch + CU/WGP count, `rocm-smi --showproductname` for the card) and read the
hardware reference that matches what you found:

| detected `gfx` | hardware reference |
|---|---|
| `gfx94*` / `gfx95*` — CDNA, Instinct MI-series | `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/amd_instinct.md` |
| `gfx11*` — RDNA3.5, Radeon / Ryzen AI client parts | `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/amd_ryzen.md` |
| `gfx1201` — RDNA4 client (R9700 class) | `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/amd_rdna4.md` |

Each opens with detection commands for that family; none is the default.
Record the card (gfx arch, CU/WGP count, memory peak) in your metrics — the roofline ceiling and
grid-sizing advice downstream depend on the real card, not an assumed one.
On RDNA4, missing MFMA%/CDNA PMC names is expected: do **not** fail the profile phase; classify from
kernel-trace + latency table (`amd_rdna4.md` §7).

## Steps
1. From `EVAL_DIR/COMMANDMENT.md` get the PROFILE and benchmark commands and the parse hint.
2. Clear cache in `WORKSPACE`, then run:
   `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/profile_kernel.sh $GPU_ID "<profile/benchmark cmd>" $EVAL_DIR/profile_output[_rN]`
   This warms up, then profiles with the architecture-specific policy and writes a report:
   gfx1201 uses rocprofv3 first; gfx942/gfx950 keep rocprof-compute first. Both degrade through
   the remaining supported tools to benchmark-only.
   If the report contains a `!!! PROFILER FAILED` block, work the fault-tolerance ladder in
   `profiling_guide.md` ("Profiler failed?"): use `<tool> --help` to find the renamed flag, re-run once
   with the named env override, then degrade deliberately — and record which tool actually ran + why in
   `profiler_used` / your summary. Do not accept a silent degrade.
3. Read the report. Extract what's available: VALU/VMEM/LDS utilization, effective HBM bandwidth,
   active vs total cycles, dependency/issue wait, L1/L2 hit rate, coalescing %, branch divergence,
   active threads/instr, VGPR/SGPR usage, scratch bytes, **and the per-kernel dispatch breakdown
   (how many distinct kernels launch per call and their % of time)** — the dispatch count is a key
   geomean signal.
4. Classify the bottleneck using the decision tree in `profiling_guide.md`:
   compute-bound / memory-bound / latency-bound / lds-bound / balanced. ALSO flag **overhead-bound**
   when per-case latencies are similar across very different problem sizes, or dispatch count > 1
   with small kernels — this points at host/dispatch overhead (see `geomean_levers.md`).
   - **Do not call it memory-bound on a small AI alone** — only when HBM/VMEM utilization is actually
     high. A small AI with low HBM util is latency-bound (`profiling_guide.md` → decision tree note).
   - **When latency-bound, name the sub-case in your opportunities**: dependency-wait dominant (C1,
     shorten the serial chain) vs issue-wait dominant (C2, raise occupancy / GPU fill). They have
     opposite fixes, so the TechLead needs the sub-case, not just "latency". Re-read this split after
     any tile / `num_stages` / `num_warps` change — it is a property of the config, not the source.
   - **Run the cheap peak/fill sanity-checks** (`profiling_guide.md` → "Cheap checks…") before trusting
     the label: any roofline efficiency > 100% is a mis-calibrated peak (use HBM%/F32), and
     On CDNA, `CTAs = Grid/Workgroup < CU count` means the GPU is not even filled. On RDNA4 compare
     first with WGP count, then sweep one and two CTAs per WGP; do not compare PyTorch's WGP-like
     `multi_processor_count` to a physical-CU threshold.
5. Write `EVAL_DIR/baseline_metrics.json` (or `round_N_metrics.json`) and
   `EVAL_DIR/profiling_summary.md` (or `round_N_shift_analysis.md`). For reprofile, include a
   BEFORE→AFTER shift section explaining why the bottleneck moved and what to target next.

If no profiler is available, fall back to benchmark-only + the per-case table + dispatch count from
`rocprof --stats` if present; still classify as best you can and SAY the profiler was unavailable.
