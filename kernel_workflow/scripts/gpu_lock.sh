# GPU lock + per-workspace build isolation wrapper.
# Usage:  cd <workspace> && bash gpu_lock.sh <gpu_id> <command...>
#
# Run EVERY kernel command (compile / correctness / benchmark / profile) through this wrapper,
# invoked from inside the workspace directory. It does three generic things — none kernel-specific:
#
#  1. flock per GPU id  -> multiple engineers can share GPUs safely (exclusive during the command).
#  2. TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR = <workspace>/.torch_ext  -> isolates the torch cpp_extension build cache
#     PER WORKSPACE. Without this, torch.utils.cpp_extension.load(name=...) compiles every engineer's
#     DIFFERENT source into ONE global cache (~/.cache/torch_extensions/...), which both serializes
#     all parallel compiles on a single global lock AND lets one engineer benchmark another's .so.
#     Deriving it from $PWD makes each isolated workspace get its own cache. (Honors a caller-set
#     TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR if already exported.)
#  3. PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH = the local GPU's gfx arch only -> avoids compiling for ~9 architectures
#     (huge compile speedup). Runtime perf and correctness are unaffected (the kernel runs on the
#     local arch either way). Honors a caller-set PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH if already exported.

# ---- Allocation fence ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GEAK_GPU_ALLOWED (comma list) is the set of GPUs the CALLER was actually allocated. When it is
# set, a <gpu_spec> naming anything outside it is refused. Unset = no fence, so every existing
# caller is unaffected.
#
# Why this exists: the spec arrives as an argv string written by whoever composes the command, and
# in an agent-driven workflow that author is a model. Agents reproduce the usage line's example
# verbatim when improvising a check outside the workflow's normal call sites. The idleness test
# below catches the common case -- a busy foreign card gets skipped -- but it is the wrong
# instrument: it asks "is this GPU free?" when the question is "is this GPU MINE?". A neighbour's
# momentarily-idle card passes idleness and fails ownership, and a run labelled "2 GPUs" silently
# becomes a 3-GPU run, which invalidates the measurement rather than merely slowing it.
#
# Enforced here because this wrapper is the single chokepoint: every compile/correctness/benchmark/
# profile command goes through it by contract, so one check also covers call sites that do not exist
# yet. A hard error rather than a silent intersection -- a caller asking for a GPU it does not own
# has a bug, and quietly running elsewhere would hide it while still producing a number.

# ---- GPU selection ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <gpu_spec> is either a single id ("2", the historical contract, unchanged) or a POOL ("0,1,2,3").
# With a pool we do not pre-assign a GPU: we take the first one that is BOTH unlocked AND idle,
# retrying until one frees. Static pre-assignment (the old `GPU_LIST[i % n]`) cannot self-balance,
# because the binding is chosen before anyone knows how long a job runs -- in a real 4-GPU run that
# left one GPU with 194 lock calls and another with 0.
#
# The pool is whatever the caller passes, so this scales to 1, 2, 4, 8 ... GPUs with no code change.
#
# IDLENESS (GEAK_GPU_REQUIRE_IDLE=1, the default) is checked against the KERNEL DRIVER via sysfs,
# not against our own locks -- a foreign tenant's job is invisible to flock but will still corrupt
# timings. Measured on an idle MI350X: gpu_busy_percent=0, mem_info_vram_used=284MB; under load:
# 100% / 1837MB. amd-smi is deliberately NOT used here: it returns EMPTY output while another
# process holds the GPU, i.e. it fails exactly when we need it. Set GEAK_GPU_REQUIRE_IDLE=0 to skip
# (e.g. deliberately co-tenanted screening runs). The default is 1 on BOTH paths: pool mode steps to
# another GPU when one is busy, single-GPU mode has nowhere to step and so fails loudly instead.
