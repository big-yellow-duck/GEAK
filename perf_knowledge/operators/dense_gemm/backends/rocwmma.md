# dense_gemm × rocwmma

> gfx120x is a supported wave32 WMMA target. Its gfx12/v8 fragment ABI differs from gfx11 and its
> WGP/CU resource model differs from CDNA. Use `amd_rdna4.md` and never hard-code WaveSize=64.

## TL;DR
> rocWMMA is a header-only C++ WMMA-style wrapper over MFMA — a **portability/teaching** API (CUDA-WMMA-
> like fragments) rather than a SOTA GEMM path. For production dense GEMM it does **not** beat tuned
> hipBLASLt/CK/asm and lacks an autotuner; use it only to port a `wmma`-based CUDA kernel quickly or as
> a readable on-ramp to MFMA. For the live serving path use [aiter.md](aiter.md)/[hipblaslt.md](hipblaslt.md).

## SOTA implementation(s)
| impl | source | gens/dtypes | measured perf | when best |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rocWMMA `fragment` GEMM (`load/mma/store_matrix_sync`) | `ROCm/rocWMMA` | gfx942/950; bf16/fp16/fp8 | no published figure competitive with tuned hipBLASLt → **use [hipblaslt.md](hipblaslt.md)/[asm.md](asm.md)** | CUDA-WMMA port / portability, not peak |

## Config space / knobs
- Fragment shape (`16×16×16` recommended over `32×32×8`), `rocwmma::fragment<matrix_a/b/accumulator>`.
- Manual LDS staging + block tiling around the fragment ops (rocWMMA gives the MMA primitive, not the
  full tiled/pipelined kernel — you write the loop, tile multiples of 8, ≥1024 WGs).
- No built-in autotuner; you hand-tune tiles/pipeline like a raw HIP kernel.

## Numerics / parity
fp32 accumulate via the accumulator fragment; parity-safe for bf16. See [../numerics.md](../numerics.md).

## Integration (rebind seam)
Build-time C++ extension; call directly from your op. No env-overlay into the live GEMM path.

## Pitfalls & anti-patterns
- Treating rocWMMA as a fast-path — it's an abstraction layer; raw `__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_*` (asm) or
  CK templates give more control and higher perf.
- Default fragment/tile choices left untuned → well below library kernels.

## How to verify
Microbench vs `hipblaslt-bench` on the same shape; expect it to lose — only keep for portability.
